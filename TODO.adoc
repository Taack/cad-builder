= Todo

* Visitor Pattern
** Validate call stack
** Trace what's happen
** Build an AST to optimize native calls
*** Use a list of objects when possible
*** Use BigDecimal the most we can
* Use consistent naming convention for extern symbols
* Restrict symbols scoping
* replace all make_... by ..._new
* call delete when possible (the sooner)
* Extract Wire class from Edge (between Edge and Face)
* make_edge to makeedge are 2 different things
